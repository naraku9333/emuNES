A simple NES emulator 

Currently in planning phase, no code written yet.
Will probably use SFML for window creation and drawing.

The goal of this project is to create a cross platform NES emulator
that can play most (if not all) NES game ROMs. 
This is for (my) educational purposes and does not really fill a public need
as there are NES emulators available.
