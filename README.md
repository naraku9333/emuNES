A simple NES emulator 

Currently in planning and testing phase. 
There is some code, loading of a rom ad storing in Processor memory.
Code doesn't do anything useful yet, I'm still reading documentation on the 6502.

The first step is to get the 6502 cpu emulation working,
then I can work on the PPU and get some graphics up (hopefully)

Will probably (almost certainly) use SFML for window creation and drawing.

The goal of this project is to create a cross platform NES emulator
that can play most (if not all) NES game ROMs. 
This is for (my) educational purposes and does not really fill a public need
as there are NES emulators available.
